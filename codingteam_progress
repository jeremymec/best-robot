------------------------------------------

- Configured the pi to work with SSH through Wifi

- Set up a basic coding workflow, and downloaded the ECS library

- Soldered Wires to Motors and connect them (More work needs to be done on wires)

- Created code to move the pi forward!

-Detached 3rd back wheel and added a temporary one.

10th May 2016
------------------------------------------------

- Opened the network gate

-Created new back wheel to fit vehicles needs.

-Cut down vehicles chassis to fit in maze as well as for uncluttering purposes.

-Lifted pi higher above base of chassis to create room for battery.

-Created and attached front bumper underneath the base of chassis to assist in vehicles balance issues.

- Wrote PID control code

- Commented on all parts of the code to let others know what's up

17th May 2016
------------------------------------------------

- IR sensor drafted

20th May 2016
------------------------------------------------

- Quadrant 3 code was completed

-Enclosed chassis draft created.

24th May 2016
------------------------------------------------

- Current State of AVC:
Hardware - IR sensors need to be fixed in place on the front, left and right sides. Wiring will need to be tidied up (such as fraying of the wires) once all components are added to the chassis. Battery may or may not need a better place to stay.
Software - First 3 quadrants have been completely implemented into one file of code (yet to upload to git). Due to changes in hardware, tuning will have to be done to make sure motor speeds and PID are working correctly.
- IR sensor was commented to increase comprehension of the code when testing

25th May 2016
------------------------------------------------

-Implemented enclosed chassis and attached IR sensors.

-Ideas of printing a battery holder discussed due to spacing issues.

- Debugged IR code

- Updated and simplified IR code to work with line follower/wall follower (fixed if statements)

31st May 2016
-----------------------------------------------
- Final testing was done for software for fine tuning of movement in maze

- Hardware finished, ditched the battery holder to keep compact size to fit in maze 

- Fixed up any hardware details such as wiring and filmsy areas of the design

1st June 2016
------------------------------------------------
- During lab time the robot completed all four quadrents getting 100% on the first try with a time of around 2 minutes and 53 seconds.

- Aesthetics were marked and produced a result of -3 points out of -20 for errors such as wiring, fimlsy battery holder etc.
